# Partner Profile Feature Implementation

## Overview
This feature adds real-time partner profile display in the Profile tab, showing partner information when users are paired, and updating immediately when a partner leaves or joins.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Join-Room Pairing (join-room.tsx)
- **Supabase Realtime Subscription**: Monitors room updates for the current user's room
- **Immediate Notifications**: Both users get notified when successfully paired
- **Navigation**: Automatically navigates to home tab after successful pairing
- **Local Logic**: Subscription is scoped only to the join-room screen

### 2. Profile Partner Display (Profile.tsx)
- **Partner Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches partner info when room data is loaded
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribes to room changes to detect partner leaving/joining
- **UI Components**: 
  - Partner profile card when paired (shows photo, username, birthdate)
  - "Waiting for Partner" message when unpaired
- **State Management**: Handles partner state updates in real-time

### 3. Supabase Integration
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Real-time Channels**: Each screen creates its own subscription channel
- **Event Filtering**: Subscriptions filter by specific room_id
- **Cleanup**: Proper channel cleanup on component unmount

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User A** creates room and waits in join-room screen
2. **User B** enters User A's room code and joins
3. **Both users** get immediate notifications and navigate to home
4. **Profile tab** shows partner information for both users
5. **Real-time updates** when either user leaves the room

### Technical Flow:
1. Room updates trigger Supabase Realtime events
2. join-room.tsx subscription handles pairing notifications
3. Profile.tsx subscription handles partner display updates
4. Partner data is fetched via existing user API endpoints
5. UI updates immediately based on room state changes

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `/frontend/src/app/(onboard)/join-room.tsx` - Pairing logic and notifications
- `/frontend/src/screens/Profile.tsx` - Partner profile display and real-time updates
- `/frontend/src/app/(onboard)/onboarding-flow.tsx` - Cloudinary upload for onboarding photos
- `/frontend/src/utils/cloudinaryUpload.ts` - Shared Cloudinary upload utility
- `/frontend/.env.example` - Added Supabase environment variables

### Key Features:
- ✅ Real-time pairing notifications for both users
- ✅ Partner profile display with photo, username, and birthdate
- ✅ Real-time updates when partner leaves
- ✅ Proper state management and cleanup
- ✅ User-friendly alerts and navigation
- ✅ Waiting state UI when no partner is present
- ✅ Consistent Cloudinary upload for all photos (onboarding, profile, entries)
- ✅ Shared upload utility for code reusability

## Testing Checklist

### Pairing Flow:
- [ ] User A creates room and sees their room code
- [ ] User B enters room code and both get paired immediately
- [ ] Both users navigate to home tab automatically
- [ ] Only the waiting user (User A) gets the Realtime notification
- [ ] The joining user (User B) gets immediate feedback

### Profile Display:
- [ ] Partner profile shows in Profile tab when paired
- [ ] Partner photo, username, and birthdate display correctly
- [ ] "Waiting for Partner" message shows when no partner
- [ ] Real-time update when partner leaves (partner profile disappears)
- [ ] Alert notification when partner leaves

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Proper cleanup when leaving room
- [ ] Handles room deletion correctly
- [ ] Works with multiple room state changes
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Subscription cleanup on navigation

## Environment Setup

Make sure to set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration (for real-time features)
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

These are the same Supabase credentials used by your backend for database operations.
